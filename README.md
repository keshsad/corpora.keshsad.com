# Corpora

Corpora is a Raycast extension designed for Raycast Pro users who leverage advanced AI models. It addresses the limitations of Raycast’s Finder AI Extension by providing a robust, AI-powered project and context management system.

Corpora allows you to define project-specific AI steering documents, enabling more relevant and dynamic AI conversations. By using file operations, the “get-documents” tool for context retrieval, and the “upsert-documents” tool for context creation and updating, Corpora enhances Raycast AI with deeper awareness of your codebases, journals, and other projects. Corpora intelligently orchestrates interactions between your AI Presets (defining behavior) and project-specific contexts, allowing for a more personalized and effective AI experience.
