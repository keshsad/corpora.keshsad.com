# Corpora

Corpora is a Raycast extension designed for Raycast Pro users who leverage advanced AI models.

Corpora creates project-specific AI context/steering documents, enabling more dynamic and accurate AI conversations. It addresses the limitations of Raycastâ€™s Finder AI Extension by providing a robust, AI-powered project and context management system.

By using file operations, the `get-documents` tool for context retrieval, and the `upsert-documents` tool for context creation and updating, Corpora enhances Raycast AI with deeper awareness of your codebases, journals, and other projects.

Corpora intelligently orchestrates interactions between your AI Presets (defining behavior) and project-specific contexts, allowing for a more personalized and effective AI experience.
